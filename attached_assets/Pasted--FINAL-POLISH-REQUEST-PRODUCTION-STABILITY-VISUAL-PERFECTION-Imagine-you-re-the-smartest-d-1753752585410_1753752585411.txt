üß† Imagine you're the smartest developer and UI/UX designer in the world. Please execute the following step by step with no misunderstandings:

---

‚úÖ 1. LOGO INTEGRATION (Header + Footer)

Replace current logos with the final versions below:

- `public/sceta.png` ‚Üí link: https://sceta.io
- `public/usc-law.png` ‚Üí link: https://www.sc.edu

üîß Design requirements:
- Load high-res images (`max-height: 55px`, preserve aspect ratio)
- All logos must be wrapped in links with `target="_blank"`
- On desktop: logos should be horizontally aligned (flex with `gap: 2rem`)
- On mobile: stack logos vertically, centered
- Add CSS/HTML comments where logos are injected for easy future updates
- Add hover effect:
```css
transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
transform: scale(1.05);
Apply margin-bottom: 15px to match flyer spacing

‚úÖ 2. FORM SUBMISSION + GOOGLE SHEETS TRACKING
