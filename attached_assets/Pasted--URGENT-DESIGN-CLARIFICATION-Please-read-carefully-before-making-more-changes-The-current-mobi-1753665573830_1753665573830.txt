‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT DESIGN CLARIFICATION ‚Äî Please read carefully before making more changes:

The current mobile version looks great ‚Äî clean, readable, visually sharp.

But the desktop view is broken. Here's what went wrong and how to fix it:

‚ùå WHAT‚ÄôS BROKEN (Desktop View)
The Lady Justice background image is getting heavily red-tinted or over-filtered.

The background overlay (probably a dark red/gradient or backdrop-filter) is muddying the artwork and destroying contrast.

Her sword, scale, and outline do not glow or stand out ‚Äî it‚Äôs dull and flat.

The main form container is too small and right-aligned. It feels crammed and weak compared to the original flyer design.

The form glow and yellow button feel disconnected from the rest of the theme.

The color scheme diverged from what we already approved:

Garnet red + neon gold + deep navy is OK

But the current maroon over-layer with opacity stack ruins the visual clarity

‚úÖ WHAT TO DO INSTEAD
Revert Lady Justice‚Äôs color and contrast to the original

Don‚Äôt apply heavy overlays or color shifts

Use her as a background image, left-aligned, with 20‚Äì25% opacity if needed

Use CSS filters subtly:

css
Copy
Edit
filter: brightness(1.1) contrast(1.05);
opacity: 0.25;
Hero section layout (Desktop)

Use a split layout: left = Lady Justice, right = content box

Content box should be wider, with:

#002B5B background (or black w/ navy tint)

Golden accents (#F5C518)

White text (Inter / DM Serif)

Use a 2-column CSS grid or flexbox

Fix the button styling

Blue button was previously better than yellow on dark

Or if yellow is used, it needs a strong shadow or glow to stand out:

css
Copy
Edit
background-color: #F5C518;
box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(245, 197, 24, 0.5);
color: #002B5B;
Ensure mobile keeps the current look

The mobile version is beautiful ‚Äî do not override its layout

Keep form centered and stacked

Hide Lady Justice below 768px if needed

üéØ Summary
Keep the Lady Justice glowing and visible ‚Äî don‚Äôt dull her out

Match the flyer‚Äôs energy and contrast

Use strong layout on desktop (not a narrow mobile-style column)

Restore approved SCETA color scheme
