Please help me finalize and polish this SCETA landing page to make it world-class, clean, and production-ready ‚Äî as if it were for a billion-dollar digital infrastructure initiative.

üß† Goal:
This is for a legal, government-backed protocol project called Protocol 402 ‚Äî we need it to feel powerful, premium, and purposeful. No template vibes. Every detail must reflect trust, innovation, and sharp execution.

üõ†Ô∏è Current Live Page:
https://protocol-402-landing-page.onrender.com

‚úÖ Here‚Äôs what needs to be fixed or upgraded based on screenshots and review:

Lady Justice Panel

Ensure she is perfectly centered and responsive on all mobile and desktop views

No pixelation or scaling issues ‚Äî preserve full visual detail

Background color gradient should transition seamlessly (avoid harsh borders at top or bottom)

Quote Section Styling

The quote by David A. Pope needs better spacing and padding

The quotation mark icon looks awkward ‚Äî use a cleaner, more elegant glyph or style it subtly

Attribution text should be 1‚Äì2pt smaller and aligned cleanly at bottom-right

CLE Approval Block

Remove all emoji (currently using ‚úÖ)

Replace with either a small checkmark SVG icon or styled text only (no symbols)

Border and padding should match the rest of the site's elegance

Join SCETA Button

Should be centered horizontally above logos on desktop only

Maintain fixed position on mobile where it is now

Add slight hover glow or pulse animation to emphasize CTA

Logos Under CTA

Ensure SCETA, TECHinLAW, and USC logos are:

Not stretched or pixelated

Spaced evenly and centered as a row

Responsive on mobile (stacked or scaled appropriately)

Form UI Polish

"Submit & Download PDF" button should have hover effect (light glow or shift)

Improve form field shadows and radius ‚Äî right now they look slightly stiff

Reduce top/bottom spacing around form to eliminate awkward gaps on mobile

Key Insights Grid

Add subtle hover animations or card glow effects

Ensure text remains vertically aligned and that icons scale cleanly

Confirm column behavior on tablets and small screens is fluid

Final Footer Logos and Text

Center footer logos perfectly below the yellow "Learn More About SCETA" button

Remove any white/harsh box backgrounds from logos if present

Ensure "¬© 2025 SCETA..." and disclaimer are readable and evenly spaced

üíé Optional Enhancements (if time allows):

Add fade-in animation on scroll for sections like "Key Insights"

Add favicon to match branding

Add meta tags and Open Graph preview for clean social sharing

üßë‚Äçüíª This page is being reviewed by government and legal stakeholders. Every polish counts. Let‚Äôs make sure all visuals are loaded properly, assets are optimized, and layout is bulletproof. No console errors. No lazy code.
