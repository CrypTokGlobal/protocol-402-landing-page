🟡 FINAL POLISH REQUEST — SCETA Protocol 402 Landing Page
Hey Assistant — we’re nearly there!

This is the final polish request to ensure the Protocol 402 landing page looks and feels like a polished billion-dollar initiative, matching South Carolina USC branding, and built to impress.

✅ DESIGN GOAL
Please match the layout, spacing, color palette, and glow effects exactly like the attached screenshots and reference video (FINAL LADY LANDING.mov). Here’s what needs to be finalized:

🔧 1. HERO SECTION POLISH (Lady Justice layout)
Form box:

Add soft inner shadow or ambient gold glow behind the white form box to make it visually "float"

Apply 12px border-radius for subtle curvature

Ensure no harsh white-on-dark clashes

Spacing:

Add more top padding above the form box so the hero layout breathes

Add vertical spacing between the “SCETA | USC | TECHINLAW” text and top edge

Ensure the form is vertically centered with Lady Justice’s pose (so sword points naturally toward it)

Text readability:

Add backdrop-filter: blur(3px) or subtle dark overlay behind the heading and form area (not over Lady Justice)

This will improve contrast on high-brightness backgrounds

🎨 2. COLOR PALETTE FINALIZATION
Update everything to the official USC theme:

Primary: Deep Burgundy → #7C0A02

Accent: Gold → #F5C518

Background: Navy/Black → #0A0F1C or #010409 (already working great!)

Apply this scheme to:

Get the Whitepaper button (Gold background, white text, burgundy glow on hover)

Headers and subheadings (Burgundy or Gold, depending on section)

Footer and Learn More CTA (deep burgundy background with gold button)

Add hover transition styles for elegance

💾 3. FORM BACKEND SETUP (Sheet.best)
Google Sheet is confirmed public and headers are set as:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
NAME | EMAIL | TIMESTAMP
We’ve generated a Sheet.best POST URL.

Please confirm:

env
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL=https://sheet.best/api/sheets/[YOUR_FINAL_API_HERE]
In /server.js:

Use fetch(process.env.GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL, { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data) })

Ensure CORS, headers, and .then or await logic handles 200 OK and displays ✅ Thank You message

Trigger auto-download of the whitepaper (hosted PDF) after success

✨ 4. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
Confirm Lady Justice hides or fades subtly on mobile for clarity

Ensure form and button are still fully visible and clean

Mobile font sizes and spacing should not break

🏁 SUCCESS =
🔥 Client opens the page and says “WOW”

💼 Form sends submissions to Sheet.best backend

🧾 PDF auto-download triggers instantly

🎨 Layout and brand colors match USC excellence

👩‍⚖️ Lady Justice remains the powerful centerpiece, not a distraction

Thank you — this is the final lap! Please take your time and let’s make this legendary ✅
