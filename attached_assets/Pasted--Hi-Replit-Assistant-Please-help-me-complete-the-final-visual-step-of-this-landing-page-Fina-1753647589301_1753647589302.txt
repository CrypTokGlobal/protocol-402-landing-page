👋 Hi Replit Assistant! Please help me complete the final visual step of this landing page.

🎯 Final Client Requirement
The client has approved the flyer with the neon Lady Justice holding a glowing sword and wants this image directly integrated into the live webpage design — not as a generic placeholder, but exactly like the flyer layout.

🖼️ Instructions to match design:

Use the Lady Justice image (lady-justice.png) I’ve uploaded as a background image on the left side of the hero/header section.

Position the figure so her sword subtly points toward the form on the right (just like the flyer).

Use a dark gradient background (black/navy/gold glow) on her half of the screen, and a light, trustworthy white/blue area on the right side of the screen where the form lives.

If needed, apply a semi-transparent black overlay or blur filter behind the text/form section so everything remains readable.

Ensure the image is not cut off on desktop or mobile. Use object-position, background-size: cover, and responsive design techniques.

The result should look like the flyer screenshot I’ve uploaded — same energy, same layout, no guesswork.

📄 Design reference:

Match the layout/energy of this flyer exactly: ✅ legal-digital-convergence-flyer.png

Sword should point at the call-to-action like the flyer

Keep the form layout we have now — just move it into that flyer context

🧠 TLDR:
Blend Lady Justice as a responsive background (left), form area on the right. Think like an art director, not just a developer — this is the “wow” moment that closes the deal. Please treat this as a final polish and art direction priority.

Let me know if any part of this needs clarification. I believe in you to make this stunning 💎

✅ Then upload or re-upload the following files:

The actual flyer screenshot you want it to match (legal-digital-convergence-flyer.png)
