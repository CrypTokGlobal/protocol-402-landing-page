👋 Hi Replit Assistant — thank you! We are at the final mile of this build. I’ve reviewed everything side-by-side with the approved flyer and current live build, and here is the last request to polish and finalize the landing page to WOW everyone.

Please treat this as a VIP-level polish pass.

🎯 FINAL GOAL
Make the landing page look exactly like the final flyer and video walkthrough — elegant, powerful, easy to read, and emotionally exciting when someone first loads it.

✅ FIX / IMPROVE THESE VISUAL DETAILS:
1. 🖼️ Lady Justice Image:
Please resize and position Lady Justice slightly more to the left and down so her sword points directly to the form

Keep her fully visible on desktop — don't crop her above the elbow

Apply a subtle fade gradient on her side if she bleeds into the form

✅ Keep:

opacity: 0.25

object-fit: contain

filter: brightness(1.1) contrast(1.2)

2. 🧊 Hero Form Background Box
Apply a soft translucent backdrop under the form:

css
Copy
Edit
backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
border-radius: 12px;
box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
Add 15–25px of padding inside the form area and more spacing between the lines of text

Make the button brighter and add a soft hover animation:

css
Copy
Edit
.form-box button:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}
3. ✨ Entry Animations
Add fade-in or upward slide to:

Main headline

Subheadline

Form container

Each card in the “What’s Inside the Protocol” section

Use keyframes or simple CSS animation — doesn’t need to be overdone.

4. 📱 Mobile Optimization
Keep Lady Justice hidden on mobile (display: none under 768px)

Stack form vertically and center everything

Shrink font size slightly so it fits on first screen without scrolling too much

5. 🔁 Scroll Feel
Make page scroll smooth:

css
Copy
Edit
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
Add scroll reveal (optional) on cards or footer logos

🧠 Final Reminder
This is going in front of USC Law, SCETA, and potential state policy funders, so it must:

Look beautiful and powerful

Read easily

Make the form and whitepaper feel important

Highlight Lady Justice as the visual symbol of integrity and future-forward legal innovation

Please apply these and let me know when ready for final review and sign-off 🙏

Thank you so much — you’ve gotten us to the finish line!
