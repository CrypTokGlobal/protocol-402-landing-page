✅ 1. Upload the image to your project
Make sure the image is uploaded to the public/ folder (or same directory as index.html) and named exactly:

bash
Copy
Edit
lady-justice.png
If it's in a different format (e.g., .jpg or .webp), rename the file or update the code accordingly.

✅ 2. Edit index.html
Your file is already correctly structured with this line:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="lady-justice.png" alt="Lady Justice" class="lady-justice" />
✅ No change needed unless the image path is wrong — just make sure that file is in the same folder or public directory.

✅ 3. Edit style.css and add this code:
Open your public/style.css and scroll to the bottom. Paste the following CSS exactly to style the image and layer it correctly behind the form:

css
Copy
Edit
.lady-justice {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  height: 100%;
  max-height: 800px;
  z-index: 0;
  opacity: 0.25;
  object-fit: cover;
  pointer-events: none;
  filter: brightness(1.1) saturate(1.1) contrast(1.05);
}

/* Ensure the hero section positions its children relative to this image */
.hero {
  position: relative;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #000000, #0c0c0c);
  color: white;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 5rem 2rem;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

/* Keep your form and text readable above the image */
.hero-content {
  position: relative;
  max-width: 900px;
  z-index: 1;
  text-align: center;
  color: white;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
  padding: 3rem 2rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
✅ Final Touches
Optional: Make it only visible on desktop
css
Copy
Edit
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .lady-justice {
    display: none;
  }
}
✅ Recap of What You Must Do:
✅ Upload lady-justice.png into the Replit file system (same folder as index.html or in public/).

✅ Make sure this line is in index.html inside .hero-content:

html
Copy
Edit
<img src="lady-justice.png" alt="Lady Justice" class="lady-justice" />
✅ Paste the CSS from above into style.css.

Once those 3 are done, refresh the Replit preview and the Lady Justice image should appear left-aligned, layered behind your hero section content exactly as in the approved flyer.
