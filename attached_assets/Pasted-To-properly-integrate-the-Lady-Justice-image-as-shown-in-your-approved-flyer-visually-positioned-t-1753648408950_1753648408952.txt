To properly integrate the Lady Justice image as shown in your approved flyer â€” visually positioned to the left with the sword pointing toward the form â€” you already have the <img src="lady-justice.png" class="lady-justice"> line in your HTML.

To fully achieve the elegant, layered result you're going for, hereâ€™s exactly what you should do in your style.css file:

âœ… Add this CSS to your style.css (or replace the existing .lady-justice styles):
css
Copy
Edit
.lady-justice {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  height: 100%;
  z-index: 0;
  opacity: 0.3;
  object-fit: cover;
  pointer-events: none;
  filter: brightness(1.1) saturate(1.1) contrast(1.05);
}

.hero {
  position: relative;
  background: linear-gradient(to right, #000000, #0c0c0c);
  color: white;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 5rem 2rem;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  font-family: 'DM Serif Display', serif;
}

.hero-content {
  position: relative;
  max-width: 900px;
  z-index: 1;
  text-align: center;
  color: white;
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);
  padding: 3rem 2rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}
ðŸ’¡ Extra polish tips:
If the image is too bold, reduce opacity to 0.2 or apply a blur() with CSS filters.

Be sure the image file is named lady-justice.png and uploaded to your Replit public/ folder.

âœ… Optional enhancement:
If you want to anchor the Lady Justice image only on larger screens, wrap the above .lady-justice rule in a media query like this:

css
Copy
Edit
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .lady-justice {
    /* ... styles as above ... */
  }
}
Once you do this, your layout will:

Match the approved design mockup,

Feature the Lady Justice figure softly in the background left,

And remain clean and readable for form + headline sections.

Let me know if you want to add motion effects (e.g., slow fade-in or parallax scroll), or need me to generate the full style.css file from scratch with all integrated!
