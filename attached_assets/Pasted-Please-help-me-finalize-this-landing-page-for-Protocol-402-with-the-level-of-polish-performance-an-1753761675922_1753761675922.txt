Please help me finalize this landing page for Protocol 402 with the level of polish, performance, and design precision worthy of a billion-dollar legal and government-backed project. This is not a startup or gimmick site — it’s being reviewed by legal commissioners, law school officials, and government partners in South Carolina. Everything must look custom-built, powerful, and production-ready.

✅ Current Live Page: https://protocol-402-landing-page.onrender.com

🧠 Objectives:

This cannot look like a template or MVP.

No unstyled elements, uneven spacing, or visual bugs.

Every section must reflect professionalism, credibility, and innovation.

📸 Based on latest screenshots and QA, please update and polish the following:

🔧 VISUAL + UI POLISH:
1. Header & Hero Section:

“Join SCETA” button: center above logos on desktop only, leave where it is on mobile.

Ensure all three logos (SCETA, USC, TECHINLAW) load clearly, with equal size, padding, and alignment.

Add subtle hover effect to “Join SCETA” (e.g. glow or smooth scale).

Remove any layout shift between hero and Lady Justice background.

2. Lady Justice Panel:

Make sure Lady Justice panel does not overflow on mobile.

Ensure it's vertically aligned with the content on the right.

Fix bottom gradient transition — it should flow smoothly into the background (not look chopped).

3. CLE Approval Block:

Remove ✅ emoji.

Replace with a styled inline icon OR just styled text (professional/legal tone).

Fix border + padding — current spacing feels inconsistent.

4. Quote Box (David A. Pope):

Add clean spacing above and below the quote.

Remove the awkward quotation mark glyph (or replace with a sleeker typographic option).

Right-align attribution text with more breathing room, and reduce its size by 1pt.

5. “Get the Whitepaper” Section:

Add hover glow to the “Submit & Download PDF” button.

Reduce vertical padding between form elements and top margin.

Add subtle box-shadow to form fields (or glow) to give them depth.

6. “Key Insights” Section:

Add subtle hover effect on each card (glow, shadow, or lift).

Ensure icons are not pixelated and scale well on retina displays.

Confirm grid is fluid across all device breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).

7. Footer Area:

Logos under “Learn More About SCETA” should be centered, evenly spaced, and scale cleanly.

Remove any white background around logos.

Ensure © 2025 SCETA text and disclaimer are not crowding the edge, use consistent margins.

🧪 Technical QA:
No console errors or asset loading failures.

Fonts and images should be compressed and optimized.

Favicon should be present and on-brand.

Add Open Graph meta tags (title, preview image, description) for link sharing.

Test mobile layout on Chrome + Safari — no overflow or horizontal scroll.

🪄 Bonus (if time allows):
Fade-in scroll animation on “Key Insights” or quote box.

Smooth scroll behavior on anchor links.

Add minor transition animation between sections for a more refined feel.

This is the final polish pass before sending to external stakeholders. Please treat every detail like it’s going in front of a Supreme Court justice and a state technology board.
