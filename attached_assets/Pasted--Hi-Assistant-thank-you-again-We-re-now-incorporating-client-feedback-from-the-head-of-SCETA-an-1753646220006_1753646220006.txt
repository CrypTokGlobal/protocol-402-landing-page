👋 Hi Assistant — thank you again! We’re now incorporating client feedback from the head of SCETA and USC Law partners, and this final version needs to feel premium, polished, and worthy of a public campaign. Please read carefully.

🔥 FINAL DESIGN GOAL:
We’re merging two looks:

The white + blue trusted landing page

With the gold glowing “Lady Justice” flyer design (uploaded)
We want to combine the professionalism of SCETA with the excitement of the event in a layout that is elegant, powerful, and not overwhelming.

🧠 Please do the following:
1. 🎨 Hero Section
Use the “Lady Justice” illustration from the flyer mockup (uploaded)

Position her on the left or right as background or layered hero art (semi-transparent if needed)

Overlay or position content beside her on desktop

Background:

Elegant gradient: deep navy → soft garnet OR deep blue with very subtle gold waves (like on the flyer)

NOT solid white anymore — this version should feel more powerful

2. ✍️ Text Stack Updates (Center-aligned or left-aligned if needed):

4. 🧩 Merge & Miniaturize the Flyer into the Page
Below the form, embed a mini version of the flyer section (uploaded images)

Include:

“Digital Asset Convergence Series”

“Legal Frontiers in the Age of Digital Capital”

With a link to “Seminar Details”

Don’t make it too large — just enough to show it’s part of the bigger initiative and tie both efforts together

Add a “See event flyer” or “See the law seminar” button (optional)

5. 📦 What’s Inside Protocol 402 Section
✅ Keep cards for:

Monetized APIs

Blockchain Finance

PalmettoCoin™

Smart Contracts

(Optional: Digital Sovereignty)

Make sure they match the flyer style:

Rounded corners

Box-shadow

Blue/Gold text accent colors

Fade-in animation on scroll

6. 📍 Footer
Collaborating Organizations (inline or stacked):

SCETA

USC Law

TECHINLAW

Make sure logos are aligned and styled cleanly

Footer background: solid dark navy or garnet

CTA button: Learn More at SCETA.io

🛠️ Additional Notes:
Mobile-first design

Use Inter + DM Serif or similar font pairing

Remove the colon from the main Protocol 402 title (per Dennis)

Ensure all brand elements match the look of USC, SCETA, and the Digital Asset flyer

🚀 Closing:
This page will be shared by USC Law, SCETA, and across state government email lists and social channels. It must impress and convert.

Once this is complete, I’ll wire in the live backend (Google Sheets) and deploy final assets.

Let’s go — this is our final polish for launch.
