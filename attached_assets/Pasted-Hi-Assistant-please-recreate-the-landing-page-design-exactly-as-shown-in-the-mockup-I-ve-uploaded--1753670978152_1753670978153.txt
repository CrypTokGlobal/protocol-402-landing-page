Hi Assistant — please recreate the landing page design exactly as shown in the mockup I’ve uploaded.

✅ STYLE & THEME

Use a deep garnet (#73000A) and gold (#F5C518) palette

Fonts: DM Serif Display for headlines, Inter for body/input text

No shadowed red gradients — we want flat design, elegant serif

Half-screen layout: Lady Justice graphic full height on left, content + form on right

✅ HERO SECTION

Bold title:
Protocol 402: SC’s Blueprint for Monetized Digital Infrastructure
(White text, large size, use proper line breaks)

Subtitle:
#AI=$BTC — Where Intelligence Meets Value
(Gold italic, slightly smaller than headline)

✅ INTERACTION

“Download Now” gold button: full-width, bold, on click scrolls to form

Form below with Your Name + Email Address inputs

After submission:

✅ Show success message (“✅ Thank you! Download starting…”)

🧾 Trigger download of this file:

💾 Submit data to:
https://api.sheetbest.com/sheets/07bd8119-35d1-486f-9b88-8646578c0ef9

✅ RESPONSIVE DESIGN

On mobile, keep Lady Justice subtle/faded in background

Center all text + form

Ensure form is not cut off or pushed too far down

✅ BONUS POLISH

Add <meta> tags for SEO & OpenGraph

Add favicon using /favicon.ico

Create /thank-you.html with 🎉 + link to SCETA.io (optional)

I want this to feel like a billion-dollar, legally backed whitepaper release. The mockup is the gold standard — just bring it to life cleanly in code.



e deep garnet and gold tones used in this display are heavily inspired by South Carolina colors, particularly those associated with:

University of South Carolina (USC): Their official primary color is Garnet (#73000A) — a deep red/maroon, often used with black, white, or gold for contrast.

SCETA's theme: Given the legal/government/innovation context, gold evokes prestige, value, and clarity — perfect for highlighting "Protocol 402" and "Digital Capital."

Balance of professionalism and energy: Burgundy feels formal, while gold feels dynamic and future-forward, especially in tech or legal infrastructure branding.

🧠 The layout choice — with Lady Justice boldly left-aligned, and the right half reserved for download interaction + branding — was meant to mirror a legal document or classic print cover but enhanced with digital flow and mobile-readiness.

If you like this direction, we can refine:

Garnet → deeper red if you want more legal intensity

Gold → slightly matte for a subtler finish

Fonts → lock in “DM Serif Display” + “Inter” pairing for all uses

Would you like me to manually proceed with a coded version of this layout for us or can you handle it?
