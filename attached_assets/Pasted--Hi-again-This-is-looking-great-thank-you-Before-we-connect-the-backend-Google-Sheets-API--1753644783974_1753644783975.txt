👋 Hi again! This is looking great — thank you!

Before we connect the backend (Google Sheets API), I’d like to polish the design and apply some final high-impact custom touches to make this landing page feel like a serious SCETA/USC-level project. These tweaks are important because this will be seen by USC Law faculty, government orgs, and potential funders. Let’s make it the most polished version.

🎨 FINAL REFINEMENTS REQUEST:
✅ 1. Replace the stars/moon emoji in the hero box header
Replace with a subtle university-inspired logo in the top left of the hero box — specifically:

Use the white USC "gate & palmetto" logo or the black-and-white USC icon uploaded (choose whichever blends best with the white/blue theme)

✅ Make sure it’s low-opacity or watermark style (not too loud or commercial)

✅ Position it as a small “badge of credibility” without disrupting layout

✅ 2. Add hover glow to the "Get the Whitepaper" button
Deep blue background

White text

On hover: light glow + pointer cursor

✅ 3. Ensure the success message feels powerful
Replace the “Thank you!” message with something more polished:

✅ Success! Your whitepaper download will begin shortly.
Be on the lookout for updates from SCETA and USC Law.

Use a slightly bolder font and green check icon if possible.

✅ 4. “What’s Inside Protocol 402?” card polish
Add box-shadow and rounded corners

Ensure each card has equal height and spacing

Make icons SVG if possible (or keep emojis aligned and size-matched)

✅ 5. Footer tweaks
Add a light line or divider above the footer content

Style the org logos inline:

SCETA | USC Law | TECHINLAW

Use the SC Department of Education seal in blue only if it looks balanced — otherwise skip

✅ 6. Mobile adjustments
Confirm the hero scales well on iPhone screens

Stack input fields vertically on mobile

Ensure the call-to-action text and form buttons are still center-aligned and visible without zooming

🧠 Optional Bonus (if quick):
Add a soft background gradient to the hero section:
→ Light blue fading into white or gold — very subtle
→ This adds polish without distracting

Once these are in place, we’re ready to hook up the backend (SheetDB + download trigger).

Let me know when you’ve applied these and I’ll move to connect the logic with zero bugs.
