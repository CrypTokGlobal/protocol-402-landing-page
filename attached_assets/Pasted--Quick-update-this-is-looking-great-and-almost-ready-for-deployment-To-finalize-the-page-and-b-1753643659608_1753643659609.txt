👋 Quick update — this is looking great and almost ready for deployment.

To finalize the page and bring it fully in line with the client’s vision, I need help with a few final polish improvements based on detailed mockups the SCETA team approved.

This landing page is going to be shared with legal teams, SC policymakers, USC Law faculty, and investors — so this needs to be clean, professional, and pixel-perfect.

✨ Please help me implement the following refinements:
🧱 1. Hero Section (Top)
Keep the white/light background — great as is ✅

Adjust spacing so the title stack feels proportional on all screen sizes

The subtext line:
Presented by SCETA, USC Law, and TECHINLAW
→ should be slightly smaller and in muted gray or serif font for visual hierarchy

✅ Good job with the form feedback message ("Thank you!" box) — clean and clear!

🧠 2. Form Adjustments
Form field spacing: Add a bit more margin between name/email inputs

Mobile stacking: Make sure the fields stack vertically on smaller screens

✅ Keep the PDF auto-download and thank you logic as-is — working great

🖼️ 3. "What’s Inside Protocol 402?" Cards
Add a very subtle light-blue drop shadow or box-shadow for each card (to lift them off the page)

Use consistent card sizing for the emojis/icons and font sizes

Confirm they stack neatly on mobile

🎨 4. Styling & Fonts
Keep using Inter for body text

Use DM Serif Display (or fallback like Playfair Display) for the main headings like the H1 and H2

Button styling:

Ensure Get the Whitepaper button has:

Deep blue background

On hover: glow or subtle box-shadow effect

Same goes for Learn More at SCETA.io in the footer

📄 5. PDF Download Confirmation
After the form submits:

Show a confirmation modal OR clear visual indicator

Add a message like:

✅ Success! Your download has started. Please check your email for future SCETA updates.

🔗 6. Final Hook
Ensure the “Download Whitepaper” button links to this final URL:

🧠 Last Note:
Let’s avoid template vibes — this should feel uniquely built for the SCETA brand.
Think: “Trusted state-level tech initiative that’s modern and clear.”

Let me know when you’ve applied these! I’ll review, test mobile responsiveness, and we’ll ship it.
