üö® FINAL VISUAL POLISH ‚Äì PRODUCTION-READY LOGO DISPLAY AND LINK INTEGRATION

üß† Please implement these refinements with zero assumptions or shortcuts. I want a clean, professional layout that perfectly reflects our SCETA partners and flyer branding.

‚úÖ 1. HEADER & FOOTER LOGO IMPLEMENTATION

Replace all current logos with these exact assets:

- `public/sceta-logo-final.png` ‚Üí Link: https://sceta.io
- `public/usc-law-logo.png` ‚Üí Link: https://www.sc.edu
- `public/techinlaw-logo.png` ‚Üí Link: https://bit.ly/Convergence01

üîß Requirements:
- Maintain original logo resolution, with `max-height: 55px` and `height: auto` to preserve proportions.
- Use `target="_blank"` on all links
- Horizontally align logos on desktop with even spacing (`gap: 2rem`)
- Center logos vertically stacked on mobile (with `flex-direction: column`)
- Apply smooth hover interaction: 
```css
transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
transform: scale(1.05);
Add margin-bottom: 15px below each logo so it mirrors the flyer spacing

Ensure logos are visible against the background (no fading or opacity bugs)

‚úÖ 2. HTML & CSS ANCHORING

Add HTML comment tags at the header and footer logos so I can find and edit them later (e.g., <!-- HEADER LOGOS START -->)

‚úÖ 3. LINKING BEHAVIOR CHECK

Clickable logos should all work on mobile and desktop

No broken images, opacity, or scaling issues

‚úÖ 4. BONUS POLISH (if possible):

Add a small aria-label to each anchor for accessibility (e.g., aria-label="Visit SCETA site")

‚úÖ After implementation, please reply with:

‚úÖ ‚ÄúALL LOGOS & LINKS INTEGRATED ‚Äî PIXEL-PERFECT ‚Äî PRODUCTION-READY‚Äù

Include the list of modified files (e.g., index.html, style.css, etc.)

### üß† Smart Notes to Keep in Mind

**From what I saw in your screenshots and video:**

1. **The SCETA logo is still low-res** or has a fade effect. Make sure the image is replaced with a clean high-res version and the CSS doesn't apply a default hover fade.
2. **The logos are slightly off-center** vertically on mobile ‚Äî ask the Assistant to set `align-items: center;` in the mobile media query and stack them evenly.
3. **Test links manually** after ‚Äî SCETA, USC, and TECHINLAW should all open in new tabs.
4. **The form is working!** Just make sure no empty fields get submitted (the blank timestamp entry in the Sheet.best feed may be from a non-blocked form submit).
5. **Dennis wants visual polish** ‚Äî so spacing, alignment, contrast, and professional visual hierarchy matter. Treat these logos like they‚Äôre on a pitch deck slide.
