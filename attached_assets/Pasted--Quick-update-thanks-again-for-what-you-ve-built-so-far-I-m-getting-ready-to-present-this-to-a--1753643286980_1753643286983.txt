👋 Quick update — thanks again for what you’ve built so far! I’m getting ready to present this to a high-level team at SCETA (South Carolina Emerging Technology Association), and I need to ensure the design fully matches the client’s preference. We are aiming to win long-term dev work with them, so this first project really matters.

Please polish and restyle the front-end based on the following instructions:

🧠 DESIGN REVISIONS NEEDED (HIGH PRIORITY):
Use a white or very light blue background for the hero section
→ This creates a professional, trustworthy appearance and matches the white/blue mockups the team loved.

Align the form horizontally on desktop, stack vertically on mobile
→ Use Flexbox or Grid as needed, but ensure clean mobile responsiveness.

Style the “Get the Whitepaper” button:

Color: Deep blue

Hover: Slight glow or shadow

Font weight: Medium-bold

Optional: subtle download icon (📥)

Use modern typography:

Headings: DM Serif Display or similar

Body: Inter, or a clean sans-serif fallback

Enhance the “What’s Inside Protocol 402?” blocks:

Use subtle drop shadows or border-radius cards

Space them evenly

Icons should match the refined, tech-forward style (can be emoji, SVG, or font-awesome)

🔗 Final PDF Connection
Please link the form submission success to this real whitepaper PDF (hosted on SCETA’s server):

After successful submission:

✅ Save the user’s Name, Email, Timestamp

✅ Display a success message (e.g., “Success! Your download is starting.”)

✅ Trigger this PDF link in a new tab OR auto-download if possible

🔥 Final Notes
This is not just a basic template job — this is a custom project tied to USC Law, government visibility, and crypto/web3 integrations. The team has already said they love the white + blue version of this layout, so let’s mirror that clean SCETA branding (white/blue/gold), but still keep the structure and form logic you’ve built.

If this goes well, I’ll be building many more SCETA-connected sites and will keep using you as my go-to dev assistant. Let’s impress them together with this one.
