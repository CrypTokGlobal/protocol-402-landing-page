👋 Hi Assistant, please help me finalize the desktop version of the SCETA Protocol 402 landing page to match the mobile version’s elegance and clarity. I’m attaching the working /index.html, and I want you to follow these exact final polish instructions:

🔧 DESIGN + FUNCTIONALITY FIXES
Lady Justice Image

Ensure the image is positioned left of the hero section content (on desktop), just like the flyer.

It should not cover the form or text.

Add a backdrop-filter: blur(1px) and brightness(0.6) effect to help text remain legible.

Only show it on screens min-width: 768px and up.

Hero Content Container

Wrap the hero-content in a styled card or translucent container with:

background: rgba(0,0,0,0.65)

backdrop-filter: blur(6px)

border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.15)

Rounded corners and padding

This ensures the text block remains readable over the background image and mimics the flyer design.

Button

The "Get the Whitepaper" button should glow subtly on hover:

css
Copy
Edit
box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(0, 102, 204, 0.4);
Typography

Confirm the following font pairing:

Headings: DM Serif Display

Body and UI: Inter

Favicon

Confirm that /favicon.ico is working (or replace with /lady-justice.png temporarily for testing)

Responsive Behavior

On mobile, hide the Lady Justice image entirely.

The form and headline should center-align on small screens.

🎉 Bonus Enhancements (Optional but appreciated)
Add a thank-you.html page with confetti emoji 🎉 and a link to sceta.io

Add Open Graph tags and meta preview image:

Edit
<meta property="og:image" content="/lady-justice.png" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
Improve desktop hero spacing so content doesn’t feel too squished

Let me know if you need any image sizes, links, or fonts confirmed. This is the final step and we want it to WOW legal, tech, and state government stakeholders alike. Thank you! 🙏
