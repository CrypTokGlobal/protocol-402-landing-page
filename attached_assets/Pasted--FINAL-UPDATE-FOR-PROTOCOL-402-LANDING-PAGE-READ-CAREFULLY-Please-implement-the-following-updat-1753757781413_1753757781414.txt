🚨 FINAL UPDATE FOR PROTOCOL 402 LANDING PAGE — READ CAREFULLY

Please implement the following updates cleanly and professionally. This is the final round before presentation. Read this thoroughly and don’t downgrade anything already working.

✅ 1. LADY JUSTICE IMAGE

Return Lady Justice image to the larger hero version used in the first draft (see reference screenshot).

Ensure it’s visually dominant, balanced alongside the form.

Keep it centered and powerful, like a cover image — don’t crop it.

✅ 2. LOGO SCALING + ALIGNMENT

Increase the size of the SCETA, USC, and TECHINLAW logos by 20–25%

Logos must remain crisp, high-res, and evenly spaced

Center the logos vertically on the garnet background panel

Keep hover effect and mobile responsiveness intact

✅ 3. ACTION BUTTONS (THANK YOU PAGE)
Add a third yellow button with these final links and labels:

🔗 Download PDF (already exists)

🔗 Visit SCETA.io (already exists)

✅ Register for TechInLaw Event → link to: https://bit.ly/Convergence01

Ensure all buttons use the same style, alignment, and spacing

✅ 4. ADD DIRECTIONAL BUTTON (TOP OF PAGE)

Add a new red button labeled "Join SCETA" directly above the logos

Link it to: https://sceta.io/membership

Use same design styling as other buttons (hover, spacing, etc.)

✅ 5. QUOTE + COURSE APPROVAL
Under the hero title or somewhere prominent (but elegant), add:

“Certainly a breathtaking document. I was only able to enjoy the executive summary, but what a great roadmap.”
— David A. Pope, CPA CGMA
Commissioner – Wyoming Stable Token Commission
Governor’s Liaison – WY Select Committee on Blockchain & Digital Innovation

Also add a single line of course text below the download headline:

✅ This CLE class has received approval from the SC Supreme Court.

✅ 6. SAFETY BACKUP
Before making any edits, save the current version as a backup branch in case Dennis wants to compare versions.
