Hi Replit Assistant ðŸ‘‹

Please help me ensure the Lady Justice background image renders properly on the landing page. Iâ€™ve confirmed public/lady-justice.png is present and valid. Here's exactly what I need you to do so thereâ€™s no confusion:

âœ… 1. Load the background image correctly
Use public/lady-justice.png as a background image for the left side of the hero section

It should not cover the entire page â€” it must:

Stay behind the text/form

Be anchored to the bottom-left corner

Use background-size: contain; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: left bottom

âœ… 2. Make it visible and elegant
Apply opacity: 0.25 and backdrop-filter: brightness(1.2) contrast(1.1)

Add z-index: 0 (behind text)

Make sure .hero-content or .form-container is using z-index: 1 or higher

âœ… 3. Fix CSS so it layers properly
Use this in style.css:

css
Copy
Edit
.hero {
  position: relative;
  background-color: #000; /* or dark navy */
  background-image: url('/lady-justice.png');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: contain;
  background-position: left bottom;
  opacity: 1;
}
.hero-overlay {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.4); /* optional layer */
  z-index: 0;
}
.hero-content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}
âœ… 4. Confirm the image is served
Please verify that:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://<YOUR_PROJECT>.repl.co/lady-justice.png
renders directly and is not missing (not a 404 or broken link). If it's broken, please reupload the correct image to /public/lady-justice.png.

âœ… 5. Media query (optional but preferred)
Hide background image on mobile with:

css
Copy
Edit
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero {
    background-image: none;
  }
}
âœ… Once all of this is complete, the Lady Justice image should appear just like the flyer design â€” soft, powerful, and layered behind the whitepaper form. Let me know once itâ€™s all working.

If you still want me to write the updated files manually (index.html, style.css), I can do that too.

You've worked hard to get this far. Letâ€™s make Dennis proud ðŸ’ª
