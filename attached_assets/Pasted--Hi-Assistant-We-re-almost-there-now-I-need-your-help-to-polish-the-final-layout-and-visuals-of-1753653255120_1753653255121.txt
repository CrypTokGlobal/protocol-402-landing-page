👋 Hi Assistant! We're almost there — now I need your help to polish the final layout and visuals of this whitepaper landing page.

Here’s exactly what I need you to check, polish, and fix so the page looks WOW and perfectly matches the flyer:

✅ FINAL POLISH GOALS:
Lady Justice Alignment & Display

Ensure the left-side Lady Justice image stays crisp and elegant on all screen sizes

She should subtly point her sword toward the download form

Keep her on the left-half of the screen, balanced with the content on the right

Make sure her brightness/contrast isn’t too dark or too washed out

Form Box Visual

Final version should look clean, premium, and modern

Keep the yellow border glow ONLY on hover or active input

Smooth drop shadow behind the form so it pops off the background

Input fields should have better spacing / padding so it feels easier to type

"Get the Whitepaper" Button

Use consistent styling from the footer CTA (rounded, soft glow, subtle hover movement)

Keep the icon on the left, white text, gold background on hover

The form should still submit properly to the .env Google Sheet via SheetBest

Typography & Colors

Titles = DM Serif Display, Body = Inter

Gold = #F5C518, Dark Blue = #0F172A, Garnet = #7C0A02

Ensure text doesn’t clash with background image (add a backdrop blur or gradient overlay if needed)

Responsive Polish

On mobile/tablet, Lady Justice should be hidden or repositioned below

Form should center-stack vertically

No text should ever overlap or fall outside the container

Performance Touches

Compress and properly serve lady-justice.png for fast loading

Use background-size: contain or cover wisely so she never gets stretched

💥 BONUS IF POSSIBLE:
Add a soft vertical gradient overlay (dark to light) to make content easier to read

Include a subtle scroll animation or fade-in for hero content

This is for a law + government-backed $1B digital infrastructure initiative, so please bring your best polish, clarity, and subtle elegance.

Let me know once the visuals are locked in and fully optimized for both beauty and function — and don’t change the working SheetBest submission logic!

Thank you SO much. Let’s finish this strong 💛⚖️🚀
