Please help me finalize and polish the SCETA Protocol 402 landing page to look like it was designed by the smartest technology in the world — no templates, no shortcuts, just elegant code and world-class UI/UX.

This is a billion-dollar legal + infrastructure proposal backed by state commissions, Supreme Court approval, and university partners. Every element should feel like legislation-grade design.

🖼️ New Lady Justice Image: Please use this version for the hero section: /static/images/lady-justice-burgundy.png (uploaded — glowing burgundy theme, no text).

🔧 FINAL POLISH REQUESTS:
1. 🧑‍⚖️ Lady Justice Panel

Replace old image with new burgundy Lady Justice (no text version).

Ensure she is centered and scales fluidly across all devices.

Eliminate harsh gradient line at bottom — make it blend smoothly into background.

No cropping or overflow on mobile/tablet.

2. ✅ Remove Green Check Emoji

Remove the ✅ emoji from the CLE approval section.

Replace it with either:

A clean inline gold check icon (SVG), or

Just bold styled text — no emojis.

Ensure the padding and border radius match the site's elegance.

3. 🔲 Quote Box (David A. Pope)

Fix spacing: top margin is too tight.

Remove or replace the top-left quotation mark glyph — it's awkward.

Reduce attribution font size by 1pt and align cleanly to bottom right.

4. 💼 Join SCETA Button

On desktop only, center above the 3 logos.

Add a soft hover glow or pulse.

Maintain current mobile placement.

5. 🖼 Logo Trio (SCETA, USC, TECHINLAW)

Make sure logos:

Are not stretched or pixelated

Align horizontally and responsively stack on smaller screens

Use consistent sizing and spacing

6. 📨 Whitepaper Form Section

Add hover effect to the “Submit & Download PDF” button (soft glow or lift).

Smooth form spacing — remove excess top and bottom padding.

Add a light shadow or neon-style border on inputs to match design system.

7. 🧱 Key Insights Grid

Add hover animations for each card (glow, lift, or inner shadow).

Ensure icons scale properly on high-res displays (not pixelated).

Confirm layout stacks evenly on mobile/tablet.

8. 🧾 Footer Section

Align “Learn More About SCETA” button with logos below.

Fix any white background blocks behind logos.

Ensure copyright text is:

Small, subtle, readable

Aligned and spaced evenly (not touching bottom edge)

🧪 Technical QA:
Check for console errors and asset loading issues

Compress and optimize all images (including Lady Justice)

Ensure full mobile and tablet responsiveness

Add Open Graph tags and favicon if not yet included

🎯 This project is now in final stakeholder review with real legal commissioners and SC infrastructure leaders. Treat it like the landing page for a constitutional amendment — clean, tight, elite.

Let me know if you need file paths or anything re-uploaded. Thank you 🙏
