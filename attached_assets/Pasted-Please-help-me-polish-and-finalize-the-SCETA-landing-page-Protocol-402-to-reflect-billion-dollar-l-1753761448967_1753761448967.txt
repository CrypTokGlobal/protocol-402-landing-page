Please help me polish and finalize the SCETA landing page (Protocol 402) to reflect billion-dollar-level quality. This is for a real legal/government stakeholder audience — every detail must look intentional, elite, and custom-built, not templated.

🧠 Project Context:
Protocol 402 is a South Carolina legal/tech initiative. This site is being reviewed by law professionals, government advisors, and partners. It must communicate innovation, clarity, and trust.

🔗 Live Site:
https://protocol-402-landing-page.onrender.com

✅ Please fix and polish the following:

1. Lady Justice Panel (Left Side)

Ensure the image is perfectly centered on all breakpoints (especially tablet)

Fix any clipping on mobile (scaling/overflow issues)

Background gradient should flow cleanly from dark to gold — avoid harsh transitions

Confirm no horizontal scrolling occurs on smaller screens

2. David A. Pope Quote Section

Adjust vertical spacing between quote and attribution (currently too tight)

Make attribution text 1–2pt smaller

Align attribution cleanly to bottom right (flush with quote box edge)

The quotation mark at the top is awkward — please use a subtle stylized glyph or omit it

3. CLE Approval Notice

✅ Emoji needs to be removed

Replace with either:

A small inline SVG icon (e.g. legal-style badge or check), or

Just styled gold text inside a rounded bordered box

Match the styling to rest of site (no emoji or unbalanced elements)

4. “Join SCETA” Button

On desktop only, center it above the 3 logos

Keep current mobile placement

Add a soft hover effect (glow or subtle lift)

5. Logos (SCETA, TECHinLAW, USC Law)

Logos should not stretch, blur, or pixelate

Match consistent sizing and padding

On mobile, ensure logos stack/resize without breaking layout

6. Get the Whitepaper Form Section

“Submit & Download PDF” button should have a hover state (brighten or glow)

Reduce the space above and below the form to remove awkward gaps

Improve border radius and shadows to match modern UI standards

7. Key Insights Cards

Add subtle card hover effect (e.g. glow or border emphasis)

Confirm they stack cleanly on mobile and tablet

Ensure icon/text spacing is balanced and not crammed

8. Footer Cleanup

Logos at bottom must center perfectly under “Learn More About SCETA”

Check for excess margin/padding or uneven alignment

Make sure all logos display without white background boxes

Ensure the copyright and disclaimer text are:

Small, readable

Not crowding the bottom

Aligned evenly

🧪 Technical QA

No layout shifts or console errors

All assets (images, fonts, logos) should be optimized and load quickly

Confirm mobile responsiveness on iOS Safari and Chrome

💎 Bonus Enhancements (if time allows):

Add scroll-based fade-in animations to “Key Insights” cards

Add favicon and Open Graph tags for link sharing

Add smooth scroll behavior when anchor links are clicked

This is a high-stakes, high-visibility page. Please treat this like it’s for a legislative tech reform bill — because it is. I want Dennis and the team to be 100% proud of this launch.
