 Exact Prompt to Send to the Replit Assistant:
Please help me finalize and polish this SCETA Protocol 402 landing page so that it meets the standard of a billion-dollar digital infrastructure proposal. This page is being reviewed by legal commissioners, state leaders, and university officials, so every detail must feel deliberate, elite, and professionally designed — not templated.

🧠 Design Objective:
Make it feel like a custom-built digital policy briefing site — modern, polished, mobile-optimized, and extremely credible.

✅ FIX THESE ISSUES FIRST:
1. Mobile Text Rendering (Critical):

The hero title “Protocol 402: South Carolina’s Path to Monetized Public Infrastructure Innovation” is currently blurry and heavily shadowed on mobile.

Fix it by:

Reducing or removing text-shadow for mobile

Ensuring the font is crisp, well-sized, and anti-aliased

Adjusting font-weight if needed to reduce blur

2. Typography on Mobile:

Ensure all fonts scale naturally (using clamp(), rem, or media queries).

All core text must stay crisp, readable, and hierarchy-aware on small screens.

3. Hero Section Image + Alignment:

The new burgundy Lady Justice image must load cleanly and responsively.

Confirm she doesn't overflow or break layout at any breakpoint.

Background gradient must blend softly into the hero.

4. Remove ✅ Emoji from CLE Approval Block:

Replace it with:

A legal-style icon (SVG), or

Just styled gold text (no emoji)

Ensure padding and spacing matches the rest of the design

🔧 ADDITIONAL POLISH ITEMS:
5. “Join SCETA” Button:

Center above the logos on desktop only

Add soft hover glow or gentle animation

6. Logos Below Hero:

SCETA, USC, and TECHINLAW logos must:

Be sized evenly

Stack gracefully on mobile

Be free of pixelation or background artifacts

7. Quote Section (David A. Pope):

Remove awkward quotation glyph

Improve spacing above and below the quote box

Slightly reduce attribution font size and right-align neatly

8. “Submit & Download PDF” Form:

Use fetch() to post to SheetBest and redirect to PDF
(Currently it shows raw JSON — fix that!)

PDF Path: /static/pdf/Protocol_402_SCETA_Whitepaper.pdf

Add hover glow to the CTA button

9. Key Insights Section:

Add hover glow or subtle card animation

Ensure spacing on mobile doesn’t collapse

10. Footer Alignment:

Align logos beneath CTA button

Add spacing between © text and bottom of page

🧪 Technical QA:
No console errors

No layout shift

No text clipping or overflow

Add favicon and Open Graph meta preview (if not already set)

🧨 This is for a statewide digital transformation initiative — the final site must feel like a policy-grade presentation, not a side project. Thank you!
