Hello Replit Assistant — this is the final polish request to complete our SCETA Protocol 402 landing page. The visual is very close to perfect, but we need a few high-impact visual tweaks and backend confirmations to guarantee the best result when the client opens the link.

🎯 GOAL: Match the design in this video/frame exactly:
📎 Reference: “FINAL LADY LANDING.mov” and attached screenshots (gold accent borders, layout spacing, button glow, and elegant form placement)

✅ VISUAL FIXES NEEDED:

Form box polish:

Add a soft inner shadow or ambient glow behind the white form box so it floats more naturally over the Lady Justice image.

Apply a slight border-radius (maybe 12px) and remove any harsh edges.

Spacing & alignment:

Add more vertical spacing above the form and below the heading block for breathing room.

Ensure the gold “SCETA | USC | TECHINLAW” logos are vertically aligned with padding between them and the top edge.

Text legibility:

Add a backdrop-filter: blur(3px) behind the text block (but not the image!) to ensure legibility over brighter parts of the background image.

Glow button polish:

Add a gold hover glow around the “Get the Whitepaper” button (soft outer shadow, not inner).

Increase contrast for white text on yellow background.

📥 GOOGLE SHEETS SETUP (for backend tracking):

The Google Sheet is public and formatted with headers: NAME, EMAIL, TIMESTAMP

I used Sheet.best to generate the URL. Please confirm:

env
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL=https://sheet.best/api/sheets/[your-custom-sheet-id]
Confirm that server.js is correctly posting the form submission using fetch(googleSheetURL, { method: 'POST', body: ... }).

📦 Files you may need to adjust:

/public/style.css for layout, shadows, fonts, mobile responsiveness

/public/index.html for form spacing, background image layering

/server.js (or index.js) to confirm the Sheet.best POST logic works

🏁 FINAL GOAL:

Must look stunning on desktop and clean/legible on mobile.

Must submit the form data to Sheet.best + auto-trigger whitepaper PDF download.

Must evoke the same power and elegance as the attached flyer mockup, with Lady Justice as the visual anchor.

You’ve got this — please make the final tweaks so we can call this DONE ✅
