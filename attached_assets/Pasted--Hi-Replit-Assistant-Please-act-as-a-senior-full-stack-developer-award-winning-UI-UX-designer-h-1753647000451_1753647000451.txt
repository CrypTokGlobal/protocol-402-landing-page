👋 Hi Replit Assistant! Please act as a senior full-stack developer + award-winning UI/UX designer helping me finalize a high-priority landing page for a billion-dollar government-backed tech and legal initiative in South Carolina. I’m relying on you to get this 100% right so there’s no misunderstandings and the client is blown away.

Here’s exactly what I need for this final version:

✅ PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is the landing page for SCETA’s Protocol 402 Whitepaper, and it must feel clean, polished, and powerful — just like the approved mockups provided below. It’s designed to:

Let users download the whitepaper

Track email + name submissions

Impress a law/government audience (USC Law, TECHINLAW, SC Department of Education)

And visually feel like a billion-dollar initiative backed by South Carolina.

🔥 FINAL VISUAL INTEGRATION
Please integrate the golden neon "Lady Justice" animation (attached as a background image) just like in the flyer. She should be:

On the left side of the hero section

Sword pointing subtly toward the “Download Whitepaper” form

Styled with a dark background gradient behind her, but…

Keep the form area light (white/blue) to retain the trustworthy government feel

👉 IMPORTANT: Blend her in tastefully, like the original flyer mockup (attached). She should not overpower the form but rather guide the user’s eye to it. If needed, use transparent overlays or backdrop-filter blur to soften behind text fields.

✨ FRONTEND POLISH REQUESTS
Title font: Use DM Serif Display for headlines, Inter for body

Color scheme: Navy Blue (#002B5B), Garnet (#7C0A02), and subtle Gold (#F5C518) accents

“Get the Whitepaper” button should:

Be deep blue

Have a soft glow hover effect

Include a 📄 or 📨 icon (already applied ✅)

Style the “What’s Inside” boxes with:

Subtle drop shadows

Hover elevation effect

Clean spacing and consistent icons

Footer should include:

SCETA, USC Law, TECHINLAW logos (or placeholders)

Legal line: © 2025 South Carolina Emerging Technology Association (SCETA). All rights reserved.

📨 FORM BEHAVIOR
Name + Email inputs

On submit:

Save to Google Sheet via App Secret GOOGLE_SHEETS_URL (I'll paste the final one in)

Show “Thank you” confirmation with ✅ icon

Auto-download the whitepaper (or link to hosted PDF: https://sceta.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/V.07.01.Protocol-402-South-Carolinas-Path-to-Monetized-Public-Infrastructure-Innovation.Final_.pdf)

🧠 USER EXPERIENCE PRIORITY
Must feel like a custom branded portal, not a template

Clean, minimalist, legally elegant, and persuasive

No unnecessary distractions — sleek, branded, modern

🧾 ATTACHMENTS YOU MUST REFERENCE:
✅ The neon Lady Justice flyer (integrate that layout and energy)

✅ Final approved layout screenshots (in white + blue)

✅ SCETA branding guidance (colors, fonts, tone)

✅ Whitepaper PDF URL

🏁 DELIVERABLES

/public/style.css

/public/script.js (only if needed)

Let’s do this! This is the final step to deliver something the legal, tech, and government community of SC will be proud of. I trust you to use world-class design instincts to polish this into a visually stunning, technically reliable masterpiece.
