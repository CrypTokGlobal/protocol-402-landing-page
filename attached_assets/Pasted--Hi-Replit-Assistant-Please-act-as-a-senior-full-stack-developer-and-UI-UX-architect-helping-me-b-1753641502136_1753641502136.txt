👋 Hi Replit Assistant! Please act as a senior full-stack developer and UI/UX architect helping me build a production-ready landing page for a high-visibility government-backed tech initiative. I’d like detailed code with thoughtful file structure, smart defaults, and clean logic that can be migrated into Squarespace or embedded externally. Use modern design best practices, mobile responsiveness, and minimal dependencies.

Now here’s the project scope:

🔥 PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Build a fully custom one-page landing site for a major state-level initiative:
SCETA — South Carolina Emerging Technology Association
Protocol 402: South Carolina’s Blueprint for Monetized Digital Infrastructure

This landing page is the primary source to collect emails and deliver the whitepaper. The experience must feel sleek, authoritative, trustworthy, and professional enough for law and government, while still appealing to crypto/Web3 audiences.

🎯 GOAL:
Design a high-quality user experience that:

Encourages users to download the whitepaper

Captures Name + Email

Saves submissions to a Google Sheet (or temp placeholder)

Can later connect to SCETA’s official email system

Looks bold and feels like a billion-dollar initiative from the first second

✅ 1. HERO SECTION (Above the Fold)
H1: South Carolina Emerging Technology Association
H2: Protocol 402 — South Carolina’s Blueprint for Monetized Digital Infrastructure
