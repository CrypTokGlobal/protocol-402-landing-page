✅ FINAL POLISH — PRODUCTION-READY ACROSS DESKTOP & MOBILE
🚨 Do not overwrite or reset anything that’s currently working. Maintain full functionality and build on top of the existing version.

This is a premium landing page being reviewed by leadership and external stakeholders. Treat this as a high-visibility, long-term project that must be clean, responsive, and refined.

✅ APPLY THE FOLLOWING ENHANCEMENTS
1. 📐 "Join SCETA" Link Position
✅ On mobile, leave as-is.

✅ On desktop, center the "Join SCETA" link above the logos.

Use flexbox or media queries to handle this independently per device.

Match vertical spacing and margin consistency above the logos.

2. 🧠 David A. Pope’s Quote Section
Italicize the full quote.

Decrease the attribution text size (name and title lines) by 1pt.

Maintain visual balance on both mobile and desktop.

3. 🖼️ Lady Justice Panel
Match or slightly enlarge her to reflect the original mockup.

Ensure no overflow or horizontal scrolling occurs on mobile.

Keep visual balance between Lady Justice and the content panel.

Scale naturally with the window size on desktop — don’t crop.

4. 📝 Seminar Registration Text Block
Add this just above the “Get the Whitepaper” section on both mobile and desktop (make it visually distinct from the form):

text
Copy
Edit
Register for: [hyperlink to registration page]
AI=$BTC + Wyoming Stable Token: A Winning Formula & Policy Framework 2030
The full phrase should be visible.

Hyperlink the entire registration title text.

Use strong styling — but avoid overpowering the page headline.

5. 📜 Supreme Court Note Placement
Move the SC Supreme Court note below the registration text, and above the PDF description text.

Keep this line:

text
Copy
Edit
✅ This CLE class has received approval from the SC Supreme Court.
Style it with slightly smaller font than the form header, but not too faint.

6. 🖥️ Desktop Priority Polish
Ensure all spacing, form layout, quote alignment, and buttons look crisp on desktop viewports first (Dennis noted this is the priority since decision-makers will view it there).

On mobile, make sure flow is stacked vertically and balanced.

🧠 Execution Guidelines:
✅ Do not remove or interfere with:

Sheet.best form submission logic

Auto PDF download

Redirect timing or fallback text

✅ Keep all logic, animations, transitions, and scaling cleanly scoped

✅ Use comments to tag editable regions for future content swaps (e.g. registration title, quote)

✅ FINAL OUTPUT:
Please respond only once the following is confirmed:

No existing features were removed or regressed
