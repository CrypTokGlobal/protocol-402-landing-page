Problem: On desktop, the Lady Justice image is pushed too far left and the right side (form container) feels crammed with harsh contrast and off-center alignment.

Fix Instruction:

Please center the entire hero section horizontally on desktop view. Use a CSS grid or flex layout so the Lady Justice image occupies 40% (left) and the form/content area 60% (right). Use media queries to ensure full-screen use on large monitors. The goal is symmetry and visual flow, not vertical stacking.

üé® 2. Color + Visual Hierarchy (Match Original Poster)
Problem: The maroon/red background doesn‚Äôt match the deep navy/blue background used in the official flyer, and breaks brand integrity.

Fix Instruction:

Please revert the hero background to deep navy gradient (#0D1117 to #002244) or use the original Lady Justice flyer background as a full-width background-image. Ensure white and gold text stays readable over it. Use slight backdrop-filter: blur(4px) under the form container for smooth contrast.

‚öñÔ∏è 3. Lady Justice Positioning
Problem: On mobile it's perfect. On desktop, Lady Justice isn't positioned properly or blending smoothly.

Fix Instruction:

Keep lady-justice.png left-aligned with opacity: 0.6 and scale to 90% height. Apply object-fit: contain or cover, and let her sword subtly point toward the whitepaper form CTA. Add mix-blend-mode: screen or lighten to integrate her softly behind the text.
