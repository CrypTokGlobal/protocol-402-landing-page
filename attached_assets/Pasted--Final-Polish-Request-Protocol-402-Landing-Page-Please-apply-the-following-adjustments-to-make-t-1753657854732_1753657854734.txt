üß† Final Polish Request: Protocol 402 Landing Page

Please apply the following adjustments to make this a visually stunning, highly readable, and technically reliable page that reflects billion-dollar-level precision:

üé® Visual/UI Enhancements
Dark Overlay Adjustment on Hero Image
‚Ä£ Reduce Lady Justice brightness only on the right side behind text (gradient overlay or backdrop-filter blur)
‚Ä£ Ensure high readability of white and yellow text (try background: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(0,0,0,0.7), rgba(0,0,0,0.1));)

Typography Polish
‚Ä£ Increase base font size by +1px for better legibility on large screens
‚Ä£ Add text-shadow to h1 and h2 to make the white pop against gold flare (e.g. text-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);)

Add Scroll Reveal or Fade-In Animation
‚Ä£ Add fade-in on form and "What‚Äôs Inside" cards when scrolling into view
‚Ä£ Use AOS (Animate on Scroll) or a simple @keyframes fadeUp if needed

Card Design Tweaks
‚Ä£ Add subtle hover transition with transform: scale(1.02)
‚Ä£ Use box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08); for smooth depth

Hero Mobile Padding
‚Ä£ Increase padding-top and padding-bottom on small screens for breathing room
